<h1>Web scraping tutorial</h1>

This notebook presents an introduction to Web scraping. Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites or other online sources and copying the data into an structured form (e.g., a database) enabling further retrieval and analysis.

For this particular tutorial, we are going to extract demografic information (e.g., country, state and population) of Colombian towns from <a href = "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipios_de_Colombia"> Wikipedia</a>.

The tutorial is written in Python and will use two different methods, of the many available, for pulling the data, <a href = "https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a> and <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a>.

The tutorial is divided into the following 4 sections:

 - **Section 1: Method Beautiful Soup**
 - **Section 2: Method Pandas**
 - **Section 3: Structuring and cleaning the data**
 - **Section 4: Data saving**
