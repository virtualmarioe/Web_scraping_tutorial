<h1>Web scraping tutorial</h1>

This tutorial aims to give a short an practical intro into Web scraping. The tutorial is not meant to be an extensive or by any mean complete documente for Web scraping. If you are interested in a more detailed tutorial I invite you to take a look at other excellent tutorials available online.

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites or other online sources and copying the data into an structured form (e.g., a database) enabling further retrieval and analysis.

For this particular tutorial, we are going to extract demografic information (e.g., country, state and population) of Colombian towns from <a href = "https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipios_de_Colombia"> Wikipedia</a>.

The tutorial is written in Python and will use two different methods, of the many available, for pulling the data, <a href = "https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a> and <a href = "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a>.

The tutorial is divided into the following 4 sections:

 - **Section 1: Method Beautiful Soup**
 - **Section 2: Method Pandas**
 - **Section 3: Structuring and cleaning the data**
 - **Section 4: Data saving**
